# Banking Data Analysis üìä

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on a banking dataset to uncover insights into customer demographics, behavior, and campaign outcomes.

---

## üìù Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing information about a bank's customers and their response to a marketing campaign. The primary goal is to identify key factors that influence whether a customer subscribes to a term deposit. The analysis involves data cleaning, visualization, and statistical exploration to extract actionable insights for the bank's marketing team.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains anonymized information about bank clients. Key attributes include:

* **Demographics:** Age, job, marital status, education.
* **Financial Profile:** Default status, housing loan, personal loan.
* **Campaign History:** Contact type, last contact duration, number of contacts.
* **Outcome:** `y` - whether the client has subscribed to a term deposit (Yes/No).

*(You can add a link to the source of your dataset here, e.g., Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository).*

## üí° Key Analyses and Insights

The analysis, conducted in the main Jupyter Notebook (`analysis.ipynb`), explores several key questions:

* **Customer Demographics:** What is the profile of the bank's average customer? Visualizations explore distributions of age, job, and marital status.
* **Campaign Effectiveness:** How do factors like contact duration and the number of contacts affect the subscription rate?
* **Financial Health:** Is there a correlation between having existing loans (housing, personal) and subscribing to a new deposit?
* **Predictive Features:** Identification of the most influential features that determine whether a customer will subscribe.

## üíª Technologies Used

* **Python**: Core language for data analysis.
* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating static and interactive visualizations.
* **Jupyter Notebook**: As the primary environment for the analysis.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run this analysis on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* pip package manager

### Installation
